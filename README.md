# Python Project 350 - Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
## The guided project can be accessed in the course at this [link](https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-functions-jupyter-notebook/)
In this guided project, you’ll work as a data analyst for a company that builds mobile apps. You’ll use Python to provide value through practical data analysis.
Our goal is to determine the kinds of apps that are likely to attract more users because the number of people using our apps affect our revenue.
To minimize risks and overhead, our validation strategy for an app idea has three steps:
  - Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.
  - If the app has a good response from users, we develop it further.
  - If the app is profitable after six months, we build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.
Because our end goal is to add the app on both Google Play and the App Store, we need to find app profiles that are successful in both markets.
